          I have a ~7 year experience in programming â€” my dad introduced me to
          Khan Academy when I was 10. I started out in the processing.js
          environment there, and gradually shifted to web development because I
          found that more appealing and useful. Life has been really hectic
          since then, but we all have to power through it anyway, don&apos;t we.
          I haven&apos;t been getting much free time because of the intensive
          course in the college, but I&apos;m trying to learn new things every
          time. On top of that, I&apos;m also a basketball and badminton player
          and I also play the electronic keyboard.

          I have been trying to get better at all these, but the life of a
          stressed-out adult can only afford this much free time. I&apos;m
          confident that I&apos;ll continue to learn more skills and expand on
          my range. While you think about considering me for your project, let
          me treat you with some cool facts.

            I have been making casual webpages on Khan Academy since I was 12,
            but learnt of the popular frameworks and libraries like React only
            when I&apos;d turned 15.

            My Khan Academy webpages receive very positive feedback, winning a
            couple of official contests too, and that in turn motivated me to
            delve deeper into the web dev world. I&apos;d say it paid off.
